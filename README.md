# reactive-planner

The present repository contains the source code of the reactive planner of the Ph.D. dissertation entitled "Reactive plan execution in multi-agent environments".

The reactive planner allows execution agents to reactively and collaboratively attend a plan failure during execution. Specifically, it is a collaborative reactive repair planner that employs bounded-structures to respond in a timely fashion to a somewhat dynamic and unpredictable environment. 

The multi-agent reactive planner allows execution agents to perform a general model, which enables a group of two agents to act coherently, overcoming the uncertainties of complex, dynamic environments to repair failures or inconsistent views of the world state.

## Source code

The folder "source-code" contains the code of the reactive planner in Java. It is executable only for a single agent. 

Please, if something fails or is missing email me : cguzman at cguz dot org.

## Video to generate the configuration file

The folder "generate-XML-GUI-video" conatins a video that shows how we generate the configuration file for the execution and simulation agents. 

If you need the code, just let me known :)
